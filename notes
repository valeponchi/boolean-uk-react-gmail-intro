Description
In this exercise, we are going to practice breaking down apps into components.

This is a great opportunity to work with a partner, it could look something like this:

- Discuss your approach to the task for 15 minutes
- Work on the exercise separately
- Have a retrospective session at the end of the day and share your learnings

Instructions
-✅ Download the files from => https://codesandbox.io/s/react-intro-starter-p4tn2?from-embed
-✅ Break down App.js into components
- Break down app.css into stylesheets
- Import the relevant stylesheets for each component

Tips
- You might find that breaking down sections of code using components isn't possible at this time, that's ok. 
Take these observations into the next few days.

Challenge
- Add a component for writing emails below the email-actions buttons, take a look at the image that comes with this message.
